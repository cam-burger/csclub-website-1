    <h3>Centripetal Force Questions</h3>
    <p>
      1. A car is moving in a circular path with a radius of 50 m at a speed of
      20 m/s. Calculate the centripetal acceleration. (8 m/s2) <br /><br />
      2. A satellite orbits a planet in a circular orbit with a radius of 1000
      km and completes one orbit in 90 minutes. What is the centripetal
      acceleration? (1.35m/s^2) <br /><br />
      3. A cyclist is riding in a circular path of radius 15 m at a speed of 5
      m/s. Determine the centripetal acceleration. (1.67m/s^2)
      <br /><br />
      4. A Ferris wheel has a radius of 10 m and completes one rotation every 30
      seconds. Find the centripetal acceleration of a passenger on the wheel.
      (0.139 m/s2)<br /><br />

      The work can be seen in relation to other absurdist works by Camus: the
      novel The Stranger (1942), the plays The Misunderstanding (1942) and
      Caligula (1944), and especially the essay The Rebel (1951).
